    "It is often not straight-forward to discern which stocks have performed better than others when looking at historical data. Stock's price changes constantly, with some events, such as economic recessions, pandemics or natural disasters heavily affecting the valuations of many companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these companies are not necessarily affected the same way, and their publicly traded price can, due to a multitude of factors, react very differently to the same events. For example, in 2020 there was the COVID-19 outbreak, eCommerce companies such as Amazon, as well as hardware manufacturers such as NVIDIA, saw a dramatic increase in the demand of their products due to the pandemic's lockdowns. We will be able to see this clearly in the data later on.\n",

The value of a company at any given time and its evolution dependes on many factors that aren't taken into account in this project. Real-world value investing requires an in-depth analysis of each company and sector, and it's still not guaranteed to yield better returns than simply investing in a market index. And above all, **Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Don't assume an investment will continue to do well in the future simply because it's done well in the past.**"
